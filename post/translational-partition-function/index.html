		<p><strong>Translational Partition Function</strong>. We consider all complexes lying within a distance x of the barrier see diagram to be activated complexes. Note that we didnt have to make this substitution to derive the third term since the partial derivative has V held constant. Write the two-dimensional translational partition function for an otherwise structureless particle. A molecule inside a cubic box of length L has the translational energy levels given by 1811 E t r h 2 n x 2 n y 2 n z 2 8 m L 2.</p>

<p>Separation of the rotational partition function from the partition functions of other degrees of freedom does not only require consideration of nuclear spin states but also the assumption that the moment of inertia is the same for all rotational states. For a perfect. Evaluate the translational partition function for H 2 confined to a volume of 100. Polyatomic molecules have in general three distinct moments of inertia about their three principal directions.
