<p>MBR Master Boot Record and GPT GUID Partition Table are two different ways of storing the partitioning information on a drive. This information includes where partitions begin and end on the physical disk so your operating system knows which sectors belong to each partition and which partition is bootable. If the MBR of Windows operating system hard disk or external hard drive has some errors then your computer will not be able to boot. At the end of the MBR is a 2-byte structure called a signature word or end of sector marker which is always set to 0x55AAA signature word also marks the end of an extended boot record EBR and the boot sector. MBR is the traditional partition table that supports older operating systems while GPT is a new replacement that doesnt have limits on the disk size and number of partitions you can create.</p>
