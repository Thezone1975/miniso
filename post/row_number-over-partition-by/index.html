		<p><strong>Row_number Over Partition By</strong>. The issue is that with this query it pulls both the most recent and 2nd most recent order. Row_number OVER partition BY. The query below shows how to assign row numbers within partitions. The ROW_NUMBER is an analytic function that assigns a sequential unique integer to each row to which it is applied either each row in the partition or each row in the result set.</p>

<p>Simple Table like below. The ORDER BY clause inside the OVER clause determines the order in which the numbers are assigned. More specifically returns the sequential number of a row within a partition of a result set starting at 1 for the first row in each partition. ROW_NUMBER OVER query_partition_clause order_by_clause. The row number will restart for each unique set of rows.</p>

<p>ROW_NUMBER numbers all rows sequentially for example 1 2 3 4 5. RANK provides the same numeric value for ties for example 1 2 2 4 5. ROW_NUMBER OVER query_partition_clause order_by_clause. Because the PARTITION BY clause is optional to the ROW_NUMBER function therefore you can omit it and ROW_NUMBER function will treat the whole window as a partition. The ORDER BY clause inside the OVER clause determines the order in which the numbers are assigned.</p>
