<p>Hard and Soft Partitioning with Oracle VM 1. If you have more cores available on the server than what youre using then you can implement hard partitioning in Oracle VM for x86. For Oracle CPU licensing purposes it is required to hardcode the cpu binding in the vmcfg file for each guest or virtual machine. This restricts your database VM to specific vCPUs Virtual CPUs and does not allow it to go outside of those limits even though more cores are technically available for use. I would personally interpret hard partitioning in a similar way of disabling cores on the CPU.</p>
