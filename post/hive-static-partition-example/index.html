		<p><strong>Hive Static Partition Example</strong>. Create external table stat_testid int name string sal int partitioned bycity string row format delimited fields terminated by location userteststat_test. If you want to use Static partition in hive you should set property. Static Partition saves your time in loading data compared to dynamic partition. This Video talks about concept of static partitions and dynamic partition in hive.</p>

<p>The data is assumed to be available partition-wise and then this data is loaded into their respective partitions. By default number of partitions allowed for single node is 100 and cluster is 1000. If you want to use Static partition in hive you should set property. This leads to performance degradation. SET hiveexecdynamicpartitionmode nonstrict. Now we have to fetch the students of a particular course.</p>

<p>Lets assume we have a data of 10 million students studying in an institute. We should know what data is coming and in which Partition we have to put it into. The difference between Static and Dynamic Partition in Hive. Static partitioning is used when the values for partition columns are known while loading the data into a Hive table. Such that each state data can be viewed separately in partitions. Lets see an example.</p>

<p>Here in the above we are loading the data specifying year as partition key and value that particular data will load into the table. We should know what data is coming and in which Partition we have to put it into. Types of Hive Partitioning in Hadoop. Dynamic partition is useful when you load a huge file into a Table X and then you run an insert query. This Video talks about concept of static partitions and dynamic partition in hive.</p>

<p>Creating Partitioned Hive table and importing data Creating Hive Table Partitioned by Multiple Columns and Importing Data Static Partitioning. This video explains advantages of partitions in Hivetypes of partitions a. Static partitions are preferred when loading big data in Hive table and it saves your time in loading data compared to dynamic partition. If we take state column as partition key and perform partitions on that India data as a whole we can able to get Number of partitions 38 partitions which is equal to number of states 38 present in India. Before HIVE can do DYNAMIC partitioning inside this STATIC segregation units.</p>

This leads to performance degradation. Set hivemapredmode strict This property set by default in hive-sitexml Static partition is in Strict Mode You should use where clause to use limit in static partition You can perform Static partition on Hive Manage table or external table.
